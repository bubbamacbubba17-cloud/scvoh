          Why Your Santa Clarita Home Didn’t Sell – And What To Do Next
        </h1>

        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          Seeing your home sit on the market and come off as <strong>expired</strong> is frustrating. You cleaned, staged,
          vacated for showings, signed paperwork, and trusted that “the system” would work. Then one day the listing is gone
          from the MLS and you are suddenly being hammered by calls and mailers from agents you have never met.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          As a listing-focused First Responder Realtor in Santa Clarita, I look at expired listings every week. Most did not
          fail because “the market is bad.” They failed because of a combination of <strong>pricing, presentation, internet
          exposure, and weak agent strategy</strong>. The good news: those are all fixable on the relist.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
          This is the straight breakdown I give expired sellers when we sit down at the kitchen table in Valencia, Saugus,
          Canyon Country, Newhall, Stevenson Ranch, Castaic, and the rest of Santa Clarita Valley.
        </p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: 600, marginTop: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.75rem' }}>
          1. Pricing: Chasing the Future Instead of Today
        </h2>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          The most common pattern I see on expireds is this: the home was priced for where the seller hoped the market would be
          in 60–90 days, not where it actually was when they listed. When buyers feel a home is priced <em>into the
          future</em>, they do not write offers – they wait for the price to “catch up” or move on to better-positioned
          properties.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          In Santa Clarita, serious buyers are tracking data. They are watching new listings, price reductions, days on market
          by neighborhood, and how quickly well-positioned homes go pending. If your price ignored that reality, buyers simply
          used your listing as a reference point and wrote offers on your competition.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
          Fix on relist: we price for <strong>today’s market and your specific micro-location</strong>, not headlines or wishful
          thinking. That does not always mean “price lower”; sometimes it means price correctly and back it with a stronger
          story and better exposure.
        </p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: 600, marginTop: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.75rem' }}>
          2. Presentation: Photos, Copy, and Showing Experience
        </h2>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          Many expired listings in Santa Clarita look like they were shot and written in a hurry. Dark, crooked photos.
          Cluttered rooms. No real story in the description. If the online presentation feels lazy, buyers assume the agent –
          and sometimes the seller – will be lazy in everything else.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          On top of that, the real-life showing experience often does not match what buyers expect: pets not secured, owners at
          home, blinds closed, or important features not highlighted. All of that quietly erodes the perceived value of your
          home and pushes buyers toward the next listing on their tour.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
          Fix on relist: we treat your home like a product launch, not a quick post. Professional photography, clear staging
          guidance, and listing copy that actually explains <strong>why</strong> your home deserves the price we are asking.
          Then we make sure the showing experience matches the promise.
        </p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: 600, marginTop: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.75rem' }}>
          3. Internet Exposure: Where Your Listing Actually Lived
        </h2>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          Most sellers assume “if it is on the MLS, it is everywhere.” Not exactly. In practice, the quality of your internet
          exposure depends on:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', paddingLeft: '1.2rem' }}>
          <li>How your agent syndicated to portals like Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, etc.</li>
          <li>Whether the listing data was clean and consistent across sites.</li>
          <li>Whether your photos and description survived the syndication process well.</li>
          <li>What your agent did <strong>beyond</strong> just MLS + syndication.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
          Fix on relist: we audit where your listing actually appeared, how it looked, and how often it was viewed and saved.
          Then we rebuild the internet footprint intentionally – including SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com, targeted email to buyers
          and agents, and direct promotion of your open house strategy instead of hoping a portal does the work for you.
        </p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: 600, marginTop: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.75rem' }}>
          4. Agent Strategy: Passive vs. Proactive
        </h2>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          Some listings fail because the agent’s plan started and ended with “put it in the MLS and wait.” No clear launch
          plan, no weekly adjustments, no direct conversations with agents who showed the property to understand feedback and
          objections.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
          Fix on relist: I run expired and relist campaigns the way I approached investigations as a First Responder. We look
          at what happened, who saw the property, what they said, and what needs to change. Then we build a written plan and
          execute against it with specific follow-ups, not hope.
        </p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: 600, marginTop: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.75rem' }}>
          5. Commission and Buyer Representation Changes
        </h2>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          With the recent changes to how buyer’s agents are paid, many sellers are hearing conflicting advice. Some agents are
          still trying to do it “the old way.” Others have not adjusted at all. If your prior listing did not have a clear,
          written explanation of how buyers’ agents were being handled, it created hesitation and confusion.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
          On my listing side, I represent <strong>you</strong> – the seller. Buyers and their agents are responsible for their
          own agreements and compensation. That has to be explained clearly in the MLS remarks, in showing instructions, and in
          conversations with buyer’s agents so everyone understands the rules before they write.
        </p>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: 600, marginTop: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.75rem' }}>
          6. Your Next Move: How To Relist Intelligently
        </h2>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
          If your Santa Clarita listing expired, you are not starting from zero. You have data: how long you were on the
          market, how many showings you had, what feedback came in, and what your online footprint looked like. The question is
          whether your next agent knows how to use it.
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
          When I sit down with an expired seller, we go through a simple process:
        </p>
        <ol style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem', paddingLeft: '1.2rem' }}>
          <li>Pull your old listing and every place it showed up online.</li>
          <li>Review photos, copy, pricing history, and showing feedback.</li>
          <li>Identify what was in your control and what was not.</li>
          <li>Build a written relist plan (pricing, presentation, exposure, strategy).</li>
          <li>Decide together whether now is the right time to act.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem', fontWeight: 600, marginTop: '1.5rem', marginBottom: '0.75rem' }}>
